libdrc - a C++ library for interaction with a Nintendo Wii U Gamepad
====================================================================

Current version: 1.0-dev

Supported features
------------------

* None

Planned features
----------------

* Support for encoding and decoding Wii U Gamepad communication protocols:
  * Video (``vstrm``)
  * Audio (``astrm``)
  * Input (``hid``)
  * Command (``cmd``)
  * Message (``msg``)

* Support for encoding and packeting video streams as expected by a DRC
* Support for feeding input data back to the operating system via UInput

Requirements
------------

libdrc currently only supports Linux operating systems patched to export the
Wi-Fi TSF as a /sys file.

This library only handles network layer 7: it assumes a DRC is already paired
to your computer and does not handle all the Wi-Fi aspects. See our TODO
project that handles these aspects of Wii U Gamepad handling.
