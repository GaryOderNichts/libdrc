Major priority
--------------

* Provide a timer class that bases itself off the TSF and provides a sub-100us
  accuracy while resyncing regularly to handle TSF drifting.

* Fix timing randomly desyncing.

* Provide an interface for audio streaming

* Gamepad mode

* Build system improvements
  * pkg-config .pc file
  * make install support

Minor priority
--------------

* "Keep aspect ratio" option for frame converter (black bars).

* Find the macroblock type causing random corruptions on PC->DRC video data.

* Accelerometer/Gyro/Compass data support

* Proper event handling class that could be used on both Win/Lin to replace the
  current eventfd/ppoll code.

* Implement PBO readback (take the code from the current drcstream codebase)

* Use one single thread for the video converter instead of having std::async
  spawning a new thread every frame.

* Detect the wlan interface used to get the TSF instead of hardcoding it.
  -- some preliminary (linux-only) support for this in tsf_linux.c

* Think about a startable/stoppable interface to be able to perform
  init/shutdown of several instances more easily.

* Using touchscreen calibration data from the UIC EEPROM (is it stored there?)

* Touchscreen pressure handling (see the TSC2046 datasheet for formulas)
