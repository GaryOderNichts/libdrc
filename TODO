Major priority
--------------

* Provide a timer class that bases itself off the TSF and provides a sub-100us
  accuracy while resyncing regularly to handle TSF drifting.

* Encode and stream video.

* Implement PBO readback (take the code from the current drcstream codebase)

* Provide an interface for audio streaming

Minor priority
--------------

* Proper event handling class that could be used on both Win/Lin to replace the
  current eventfd/ppoll code.

* Use one single thread for the video converter instead of having std::async
  spawning a new thread every frame.

* Detect the wlan interface used to get the TSF instead of hardcoding it.

* Gamepad mode

* Think about a startable/stoppable interface to be able to perform
  init/shutdown of several instances more easily.
