Major priority
--------------

* Write docs and update README.

* Fix video streaming timing randomly desyncing.

* Fix compatibility with recent DRC fw (video stream never syncing)

* CMD protocol handlers

* H264 decoding support (for DRC camera and DRH video)

* ASTRM/VSTRM receivers (for DRC camera/mic and DRH vid/aud)

* HID sender

Minor priority
--------------

* Find the macroblock type causing random corruptions on PC->DRC video data.

* Accelerometer/Gyro/Compass data support

* Implement PBO readback (take the code from the current drcstream codebase)

* Use one single thread for the video converter instead of having std::async
  spawning a new thread every frame.

* Detect the wlan interface used to get the TSF instead of hardcoding it.
  -- some preliminary (linux-only) support for this in tsf_linux.c

* Think about a startable/stoppable interface to be able to perform
  init/shutdown of several instances more easily.

* Touchscreen pressure handling (see the TSC2046 datasheet for formulas)

* Use condition variables in the audio streamer instead of continuously polling
  if we are in underflow condition.

* Integrate drcuinput inside libdrc as some special input receiver/handler

* Document the camera settings from UvcUacCmdPacket.

* Divide by 16 the number of eventfds used by EventMachine by using all bits of
  the eventfd u64

* Perform audio resampling internally if needed instead of requiring 48KHz s16
  LE stereo

* Refactor the system input feeder to provide init/stop on the backends and
  avoid the dirty global variables.
